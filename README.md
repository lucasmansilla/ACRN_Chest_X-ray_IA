# Learning Deformable Registration of Medical Images with Anatomical Constraints
Repository of AC-RegNet, a new method to regularize CNN-based deformable image registration by considering global anatomical priors in the form of segmentation masks.

In this repository you can find the AC-RegNet source code and results produced for the "Learning deformable registration of medical images with anatomical constraints. L. Mansilla, D.H. Milone and E. Ferrante. Neural Networks ISSN: 0893-6080 (2020, Elsevier)." paper. You can download our paper from [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07183).
